# glacierhack2017
Code and notes for the 2017 UW eScience geohackweek GlacierHack project

## Objectives
- To learn new skills to work with large raster datasets, specifically high-resolution DEMs
- Learn how to calcluate elevation change, volume change, and geodetic mass balance from DEM time series
- Explore options to integrate DEM time series into Google Earth Engine
- Explore options to implement various processing steps in Google Earth Engine or other cloud-based processing platform

## Background material
- Rainier DEM Example from ghw2017 raster tutorial: https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/06-pygeotools_rainier/

## Packages
- GDAL
- NumPy
- pygeotools
- demcoreg
- vmap
- Ames Stereo Pipeline (download precompiled binaries [here](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/) and add bin directory to your PATH)

## Sub-projects

### Geodetic mass balance
Lead(s): @mattols, @spectorp

Sources of input data:
- High-resolution DEMs derived from stereo imagery
- SRTM 1-arcsec data (30-m)

### Feature-tracking and velocity map time series
Lead(s): @willkochtitzky

We will explore [vmap](https://github.com/dshean/vmap) tools (wrappers around the Ames Stereo Pipeline correlator) to generate time series of velocity maps.  

Sources of input data for velocity maps include:
- High-resolution image data from DigitalGlobe, Planet, LS8, Sentinel, etc.
- High-resolution shaded relief maps derived from 2-m Stereo DEMs (see 

### Debris thickness modeling
Lead(s): @drounce

Attempt to estimate debris thickness using LS thermal IR imagery, output from an energy balance model, and observed elevation change data

### Lagrangian elevation change for mountain glaciers
Lead(s): @dshean 

Integrate elevation change and velocity measurements to extract Lagrangian Dh/Dt and local debris thickness change maps for comparison with debris thickness models.

## Candidate sites
Let's identify one or more sites with a good, dense time series of DEM/image data.  See count maps and indices.
